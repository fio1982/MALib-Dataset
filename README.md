# MALib-Dataset

## Introduction

This is an open-source dataset which contains 56,000+ mobile apps gathered from Google Play and 763 corresponding third-party libraries that have been used by those apps. 

It can be used for investigating the potential relationship between the existing mobile apps and the third-party libraries. Typically, it can be used for recommending potential useful third-party libraries for mobile apps underdeveloped.

Please feel free to use this dataset in your research, and it would be appreciated if you could cite the following paper.
